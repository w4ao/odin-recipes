# odin-recipes
This project is focused on displaying the HTML knowledge I have gained thus far within the Foundations course of the Odin Project.

So far I have used Terminal to create a "repos" folder on my home folder, created an "odin-recipes" repository on github, used Terminal to clone the repository to my computer with an SSH key, used Terminal to open the repository in VS Code, and I am now using VS Code to edit the README file of the repository.
